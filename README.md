# ATMEGA32-Driver-Library

## Project's Aim and Description
The project's aim is to develop a driver library for the ATMEGA32 as a practice for studying Embedded Systems along with GithHub. The project's will include Microcontroller Architecture Layer (MCAL) driver modules such as DIO, timers, ADC and external interrupts. Also it will include other Hardware Architecture Layer (HAL) driver modules such as Push Button, LED and other electronic modules. I hope by sharing this will be a great benefit to those who are starting to learn about Embedded Systems, especially in MCAL and HAL layers. I am very open to your opinions under the community guidlines and also for modifications, improvement and collaborative work.
